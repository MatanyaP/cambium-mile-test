# Briefing Document: Level 5 Leadership - The Triumph of Humility and Fierce Resolve

**Source:** "Level 5 Leadership: The Triumph of Humility and Fierce Resolve" by Jim Collins, published on HBR.org (January 1, 2001)

## Introduction

This document analyzes Jim Collins's research on "Level 5 Leadership," a concept that emerged from a study of companies that transitioned from "good" to "great" performance. The research identifies a specific type of leader as a crucial element in achieving and sustaining such a transformation, a leader characterized by a paradoxical combination of extreme personal humility and intense professional will. This briefing will outline the key findings of Collins's research, highlight examples of Level 5 leaders, and explore the implications of this leadership model.

## Key Themes and Concepts

### The Good-to-Great Transformation
- Collins's research focused on identifying companies that moved from sustained average performance to sustained exceptional performance.
- The study analyzed 1,435 companies from the Fortune 500 list (1965-1995) and identified 11 companies that met specific criteria, including a period of 15 years of stock performance at or below the general market, followed by 15 years of performance at least 3x greater than the market.
- These 11 “good-to-great” companies achieved average cumulative stock returns 6.9 times the general stock market in the 15 years after their transition point.
- The transformation was not found to be related to industry, timing, company size or circumstances but consistently associated with certain practices, including having Level 5 leadership.
- The research utilized a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, including analyzing thousands of articles, conducting interviews, and reviewing financial metrics.

### Level 5 Leadership Defined
- Level 5 leadership is the highest level in a hierarchy of executive capabilities.
- It is characterized by a paradoxical combination of "extreme personal humility" and "intense professional will."
- Collins's research showed that "good-to-great transformations don't happen without Level 5 leaders at the helm. They just don't."
- Level 5 leaders are often unassuming, avoid the limelight, and focus on the success of the company rather than personal gain or recognition.
- They are not necessarily charismatic, but they are determined and driven to achieve excellence for the organization.

### Counter-Intuitive Discovery
- The discovery of Level 5 leadership was counter-intuitive and not what the researchers expected.
- The researchers initially attempted to downplay the role of top executives.
- The findings contradicted the common belief that large-than-life, celebrity CEOs are required to drive companies from good to great. Collins states, "Level 5 is an empirical finding, not an ideological one. And that’s important to note, given how much the Level 5 finding contradicts not only conventional wisdom but much of management theory to date.”

### Examples of Level 5 Leaders
- **Darwin E. Smith (Kimberly-Clark):** "Shy, unpretentious, even awkward" lawyer who transformed Kimberly-Clark into a leading consumer paper products company through fierce resolve, including selling off mills and focusing on consumer products. He had a "lack of pretense was coupled with a fierce, even stoic, resolve toward life."
- **Colman M. Mockler (Gillette):** A reserved, gracious man who demonstrated relentless determination in the face of hostile takeover attempts. He maintained a calm and courteous demeanor despite great pressures.
- **George Cain (Abbott Laboratories):** Lacked an inspiring personality but had "inspired standards" and relentlessly imposed his will for greatness on Abbott. He destroyed nepotism and rebuilt the company with the best people.
- **Charles R. "Cork" Walgreen III (Walgreens):** Transformed Walgreens into a convenient drugstore company by methodically phasing out the company’s food service operations despite a long family tradition of this business and the naming of food locations after him.
- **Alan L. Wurtzel (Circuit City):** The leader responsible for turning Circuit City from a failing company into a successful retailer, downplayed his role, attributing the company’s success to luck and a good industry.
- **Joseph F. Cullman III (Philip Morris):** Refused to take credit for his company's success, citing his good fortune to have great colleagues, successors, and predecessors.

### The Yin and Yang of Level 5
- Level 5 leadership involves a duality: modesty and will, shyness and fearlessness.
- This contrasts with Level 4 leaders who are often characterized by ego and self-promotion.
- Collins states: “Humility + Will = Level 5”

### Comparison to Level 4 Leaders
- Level 4 leaders can be charismatic and drive success, but they often lack the humility to set up a company for sustained greatness.
- They focus on personal gain and celebrity rather than building a lasting organization.
- **Examples of Level 4 leaders cited:**
  - **Al Dunlap (Scott Paper):** Self-promoter who made $100 million in 603 days by slashing costs and selling off the company. Collins calls Dunlap a "Rambo in pinstripes."
  - **Lee Iacocca (Chrysler):** Achieved a turnaround but shifted focus to personal celebrity, leading to a decline in the company's performance in the second half of his tenure. “Iacocca’s personal stock soared, but Chrysler’s stock fell 31% below the market in the second half of his tenure.”
  - **Stanley C. Gault (Rubbermaid):** A hard-driving, egocentric executive under whose leadership Rubbermaid grew dramatically but declined as quickly following his departure due to a leadership void. Gault was “a tremendous Level 4 leader, perhaps one of the best in the last 50 years. But he was not at Level 5, and that is one crucial reason why Rubbermaid went from good to great for a brief, shining moment and then just as quickly went from great to irrelevant.”

### The Window and the Mirror
- Level 5 leaders attribute success to external factors or luck ("looking out the window") and take responsibility for failures ("looking in the mirror").
- Level 4 leaders do the opposite, blaming external factors for failures and taking credit for successes.
- Collins states “Level 5 leaders look out the window to assign credit—even undue credit. They look in the mirror to assign blame, never citing external factors.”

### Other Factors in Good-to-Great Transformations
Level 5 leadership is essential but not the only factor. Other critical components include:
- **First Who, Then What:** Getting the right people on the bus, and the wrong people off, before determining the strategy.
- **The Stockdale Paradox:** Confronting brutal facts while maintaining faith in the ultimate success.
- **Buildup-Breakthrough Flywheel:** Sustained, consistent effort that builds momentum rather than relying on big leaps or programs.
- **The Hedgehog Concept:** Focusing on one core thing that aligns what a company can be best in the world at, its economics, and the passions of its people.
- **Technology Accelerators:** Using selected technologies to accelerate progress, rather than jumping on technology bandwagons.
- **Culture of Discipline:** Combining disciplined people, thought, and action with an entrepreneurial spirit.

### Can Level 5 Leadership Be Developed?
- The research is not definitive on how Level 5 leaders emerge.
- Collins speculates that there are two categories of people: those who can never reach Level 5 and those who have the seed but may not develop it.
  - “The first category consists of people who could never in a million years bring themselves to subjugate their own needs to the greater ambition of something larger and more lasting than themselves.”
- Experiences such as near-death, religious conversion, significant life events might spark the development of Level 5, but this is speculative.
- The study did not examine the psychological roots of Level 5 leadership.
- Practicing the other disciplines of good-to-great transformation may help foster development towards Level 5 leadership, but no guarantee of success exists.

## Conclusion

Jim Collins's research highlights the critical role of Level 5 leadership in driving companies from good to great. This leadership style, characterized by humility and fierce will, is a key differentiator between companies that achieve sustained exceptional performance and those that remain mediocre. The research provides a valuable framework for understanding leadership at its highest level, although it raises the question of how to develop such leaders. The findings suggest that while Level 5 leadership may be innate, focusing on other good-to-great principles and the development of humility may serve as a starting point. Even if an organization is unsure of its own journey to Level 5, it is “worth trying” as “all that we touch will be the better for making the effort to get there.”
