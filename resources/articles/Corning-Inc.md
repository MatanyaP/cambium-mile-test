# Briefing Document: Corning Inc. - A Legacy of Innovation and Strategic Adaptation

## Executive Summary:
This document provides an overview of Corning Incorporated's history, with a particular focus on the leadership of Wendell Weeks. The company, known for its long history of life-changing innovations, faced significant challenges and transformations, particularly during the dot-com bust of the early 2000s. Under Weeks, Corning navigated near-bankruptcy and repositioned itself for future success by prioritizing a strategic framework focusing on core competencies and patient investment in long-term innovation. The case study highlights key decisions and challenges around the development of Gorilla Glass and Valor Glass.

## Key Themes and Ideas:

### A History of Innovation:
- Corning's history dates back to 1851, and the company has a long track record of developing innovative products in materials science. Early innovations include glass encasements for Edison's light bulb, Pyrex bakeware, and glass tubes for radios and televisions.
- The company's success has often stemmed from scientific research done decades earlier. For example, fiber optics, developed in 1970, became critical to the telecommunications boom of the 1990s.
  
  **Quote:**  
  *“Corning has a 164-year track record of life-changing innovation, and we are committed to another 164 years.”* - Chairman, CEO Wendell Weeks

### The Dot-Com Bubble and Near Collapse:
- Corning experienced rapid growth in the late 1990s due to its dominance in fiber optics. At one point, this segment accounted for over 70% of Corning's revenues.
- The dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s, causing a severe drop in demand for fiber optics, leading to massive losses and a near-collapse of the company. Corning stock dropped from $290 per share in 2000 to around $4 in 2002.
  
  **Quote:**  
  *“We thought the stock price would go to the sky... Our Telecom business unraveled really quickly. You have to ask yourself what we were really thinking back then.”* - James Flaws, CFO at the time

### Wendell Weeks' Leadership and Turnaround:
- Despite being in charge of the telecom division when the bubble burst, Wendell Weeks was promoted to President and COO after CEO John Loose retired and Jamie Houghton returned to the CEO position in 2002.
- Weeks was instrumental in stabilizing Corning after the dot-com crisis. He led a corporate strategy framework focusing on stability, balance, and growth through innovation, and emphasized the importance of cash flow and a disciplined approach to business.
  
  **Quote:**  
  *"The key was to have stability and balance while we pursued growth through innovation. You need be able to weather the bad times, which are sure to come. ...what really matters is to have cash."* - Wendell Weeks

- Weeks broke down silos and fostered a "one company" mentality where resources and talent were shared across different business segments.

### The "Long Blue Line" and Patient Capital:
- Weeks coined the phrase "the long blue line" to represent the continuity of leadership and innovation at Corning. He emphasized the company's commitment to its traditions and values.
- Weeks promoted the concept of "patient capital," which involves investing in unproven technologies even if there are no immediate commercial applications. Corning historically has had long-term views on returns.
  
  **Quote:**  
  *"When you evaluate our own history, what we were good at was growth through large life-changing innovation that may not have shown a strong return for 10 years, or more. Almost all of our really big innovations have required that sort of time scale. There are copious companies that will compete with you over a three- or five-year time period. There are only few that are willing to commit to a 10-year timeframe."* - Wendell Weeks

### The "3-4-5" Innovation Framework:
- To focus its R&D efforts, Weeks introduced the "3-4-5" framework:
  - **3 Core Technologies:** Glass science, ceramic science, and optical physics
  - **4 Manufacturing and Engineering Platforms:** Extrusion, fusion, precision forming, and vapor deposition.
  - **5 Market-Access Platforms:** Automotive, display, mobile consumer electronics, optical communications, and life science vessels.
- 80% of Corning's R&D investments were mandated to fall within this framework.

  **Quote:**  
  *“The 3-4-5 framework tells us to quit working on things that we are not expert in. It also reminds us that in these areas of expertise there is more we can do.”* – David Morse, Chief Technology Officer.

### Emerging Innovations Group (EIG):
- Established in 2012, the EIG incubates new ideas and helps convert research into commercially viable products, working outside of the main business divisions.
- EIG's focus is on long-term "big bet" innovations and aligns with the Corporate Science and Technology Group.

### Strategic Decision-Making and Risk:
- The case highlights the challenges of balancing long-term innovation with the need for immediate cash flow. The company had to make choices, sometimes difficult ones, about where to invest resources.
- The decision to partner with Apple on the first iPhone's cover glass, despite the need to shift resources from the lucrative LCD business, was a pivotal risk that paid off handsomely with the introduction of Gorilla Glass.

  **Quote:**  
  *“Are we really going to take our very best resources from the business that was saving us today to do an ‘emergency thing’ for this guy Jobs on the West Coast?”* - David Loeber, business director

### Gorilla Glass:
- Initially based on the shelved Chemcor technology, Gorilla Glass was developed in response to a call from Steve Jobs.
- It demonstrates the importance of leveraging past research for new applications.
- Corning initially was worried about failing to meet the demands of the iPhone launch, but Steve Jobs pushed the company to bet on itself, demonstrating the importance of strong customer relationships.
- Later, Gorilla Glass expanded into the automotive sector, with applications for interiors and exteriors.
- It took Corning a long time to develop a process to have a viable and desired product, however.

### Valor Glass:
- Valor Glass is a pharmaceutical packaging product developed to address issues with breakage, cracks, and delamination in conventional glass vials.
- It involved a large investment ($200 million) and collaboration with Merck, which Weeks was on the board of.
- The development faced significant challenges, including unexpected breakage and potential incompatibility with drug products.
- The product was significantly more expensive to produce than conventional vials, which presented a challenge for market adoption.
- The development highlights the struggle between short-term cost savings and long-term benefits of higher quality products, and the challenges of convincing an industry to switch from a commodity product.
- Corning was faced with a difficult decision on whether to continue investing in Valor Glass or redirecting funds to other products.

## Key Questions Raised in the Case:
1. How should Corning balance its long-term innovation goals with short-term financial pressures?
2. How can Corning effectively identify and pursue "big bet" opportunities that have long time scales for returns?
3. How can Corning navigate the challenges of introducing disruptive technologies into existing markets (as seen with automotive glass and pharmaceutical packaging)?
4. How should Corning decide whether to continue investing in a promising project that is struggling or redirect resources to other projects?
5. How does Corning's ability to leverage past research and innovation contribute to its success?
6. How has the company's culture contributed to its success and how has it needed to adapt over time?

## Conclusion:
The case study of Wendell Weeks at Corning Inc. provides valuable insights into managing a company with a legacy of innovation. It shows how strategic leadership, a commitment to core competencies, patient investment, and the willingness to take calculated risks can lead to long-term success, especially in the face of major industry disruptions. The decision regarding Valor Glass highlights the complexities of long-term innovation investments and the importance of weighing long-term potential against near-term uncertainties. Ultimately, Corning's turnaround and renewed focus on its strengths underscore the importance of adaptability and a long-term vision in a rapidly changing world.
