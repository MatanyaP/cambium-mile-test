# Briefing Document: Claude Grunitzky - A Transcultural Entrepreneur

## Executive Summary:

This document reviews the career of Claude Grunitzky, a serial entrepreneur with a diverse background spanning Togo, France, the UK, and the US. The document explores Grunitzky's journey from a culturally-aware youth to a prominent media and advertising figure, highlighting his focus on urban culture, transculturalism, and his keen ability to build and leverage a powerful network. The case study culminates with his transition into a new venture focused on mobile and social media in Africa.

## Key Themes:

### Transculturalism and Identity:
Grunitzky's life is marked by a constant negotiation of multiple cultural identities. He navigates the worlds of privilege and poverty, traditional African upbringing and European education, and hip-hop rebellion and establishment acceptance. This fluidity shapes his personal and professional life. He himself defines the core of transculturalism as: 
> "Transculturalism describes how individuals are able to transcend their native culture, in order to explore, examine, and infiltrate foreign cultures."

### The Power of Networks:
Grunitzky's success is significantly attributed to his ability to build and maintain a diverse and influential network. He is meticulous in managing connections, viewing each encounter as an opportunity, and using both digital and face-to-face interactions to foster relationships. He notes:
> "I never lose a business card. I noticed that when you meet someone at a party, often they will take your number and say ‘Oh, let’s meet up,’ but some people never call. They are being superficial. I was the opposite. I was that guy that made sure that I followed up with every single person.”

### Entrepreneurial Drive and Vision:
Grunitzky demonstrates a consistent drive to create and innovate, from his early forays into magazine publishing to his later ventures in advertising and television. He shows an ability to identify emerging cultural trends, specifically hip-hop and urban culture, and capitalize on them. This ability to be ahead of the curve helps him create new businesses, such as “Trace” magazine and True Agency.

### Evolution and Adaptation:
Grunitzky's businesses reflect his personal evolution. He moves from focusing on hip-hop to embracing transculturalism as he broadens his global exposure. Similarly, he transitions from a creative magazine editor to a more business-oriented entrepreneur, although the case study makes it clear that he always had a keen sense for the business opportunities afforded to him.

### The tension between "outsider" and "establishment":
Grunitzky constantly straddles the line between being an outsider, especially with his early embrace of hip-hop culture, and being accepted into established circles. As he gains wealth and status he begins to meet "the elite at the top of New York society," but he notes that to truly connect with the establishment in France, 
> "I would have to give up something of myself and be subservient to them." 
This tension fuels his desire to use his position to create social change.

## Key Ideas and Facts:

### Early Life and Influences:
- Born in Togo in 1971 into a politically influential family. His father was a government minister.
- Experienced a mix of privilege and poverty due to his parents' differing backgrounds.
- Moved to Washington DC at age 8, where he attended a French international school which he notes as his most transformative experience, exposing him to diverse cultures and perspectives.
- Attended a strict Catholic boarding school in France, which provided a sharp contrast to his American experiences and where he faced racial discrimination and exclusion.

### Embracing Hip-Hop and Media:
- Discovered hip-hop culture in Paris, which provided him with a sense of community and became a defining aspect of his identity.
- Developed a passion for writing and began working for free at Dazed and Confused magazine in London, where he honed his journalistic skills and created a network.
- His embrace of hip-hop created conflict with his traditional father, who valued a more conservative African way of life. He remarks, "The African way is to be proper. Educated Africans especially are always well dressed, well spoken, and the whole hip-hop thing was about rebellion."

### Entrepreneurial Ventures:
- Co-founded True magazine with his cousin, focusing on hip-hop, film, and fashion, but closed it due to disagreements.
- Launched Trace magazine, a more focused urban publication, which gained traction in the UK and the US.

### Network Building and Maintenance:
- Maintained both a handwritten notebook and a digital database to manage his growing list of contacts.
- Utilized face-to-face meetings, phone calls, emails, and social media to keep in touch with his network.
- Emphasized reciprocation and was willing to "cut a tie" with individuals he felt were ungrateful.
- Notable figures who became part of his network include Jefferson Hack (Dazed and Confused), RZA (Wu-Tang Clan), Bethann Hardison, Iman, and Sylvia Rhone, all of whom helped Grunitzky in different ways.

### Growth and Challenges:
- Expanded Trace into New York in 1998, facing financial difficulties until RZA from Wu-Tang Clan provided emergency funding.
- Founded True Agency in 2002 with Richard Wayner, which became a successful advertising agency.
- His growing business and lifestyle led to the dissolution of his marriage in 2005.
- The transition from a creative editor to a businessman proved challenging for Grunitzky, who had to learn corporate strategies and financial management.
- Experienced a financial setback in 2008 due to the recession, which led to the closure of True Agency.

### Shifting Focus and New Ventures:
- Sold the Trace businesses in 2010.
- Entered the MIT Sloan Fellows Program in 2011 to refine his business skills and plan his next venture.
- Launched True Africa, a mobile directory service for African service providers, in 2012, inspired by his mother's struggles as a seamstress. He hoped to use his skills to help people similar to his mother.

### Future Aspirations:
Grunitzky aims to create a successful business in Africa, and also has an interest in a political career, seeking to leverage his experiences to effect societal change. He notes,
> "I realized that I was probably one of the only people who could connect with the black intelligentsia, with Paris, with Africa, with Brazil, with the gay world, with the creative world, and with Wall Street. I had connections to all of these worlds and I felt that I could bring them together and utilize that to solidify my power base."
