# Briefing Document: NIC+ZOE Case Study

**Date:** October 26, 2023  
**Subject:** Analysis of NIC+ZOE’s Challenges and Opportunities under New CEO Susie Mulder

## 1. Executive Summary

This case study focuses on Susie Mulder's first few months as CEO of NIC+ZOE, a women's apparel company. While NIC+ZOE has experienced revenue growth and secured private equity (PE) investment, it faces significant operational and strategic challenges that threaten its profitability and future growth. The company operates in a highly competitive, fast-paced fashion industry that requires a combination of creativity and execution. The case explores the company’s internal culture, its struggles with deadlines, and strategic decisions about e-commerce. Mulder must address these challenges and create an action plan that can satisfy the PE investors' growth expectations.

## 2. Company Background

**Founding & Niche:** NIC+ZOE was founded in 2005 by Kent Spellman and Dorian Lightbown, targeting the 35-55 age group of women with unique and fashionable knitwear. The brand is named after Lightbown's children.  
**Product Focus:** Known for innovative knitwear, sophisticated prints, bold colors, and flattering fit.  
**Distribution:** Relies on relationships with over 800 specialty stores and key department stores like Nordstrom (which accounts for 40% of sales). Other department stores represent 20% of sales.  
**Financial Growth:** By 2011, revenues reached over $40 million with gross margins around 35% and profits of nearly $5 million. However, in 2011 margins were eroded by high air freight costs, and projected to be eroded further.  
**PE Investment:** In 2012, two PE firms took minority stakes, leading to the hiring of a new CEO.  
**Flat Organizational Structure:** NIC+ZOE operates with a flat structure and limited administrative support. The core operations are overseen by four executives: Dorian Lightbown (Design), Sarah Bind (Merchandising, Marketing and Sales), Jim Buckley (CFO), and Kevin Muldoon (Distribution).

## 3. Susie Mulder: The New CEO

**Background:** Mulder has an MBA from Harvard Business School, and worked at McKinsey and Company. She built a reputation for strong leadership, client service and practical recommendations.  
**Motivation:** She stepped back from her high-intensity consulting career to focus on family after a health scare with her daughter, but continued her career part time at McKinsey.  
**Appointment:** She was hired for her "personality, her intelligence, her drive, and her ideas for the business", despite her lack of direct retail operating experience.  
**Approach:** Mulder is described as having an "active listening mode," meeting with every employee and actively seeking their input.

## 4. Key Themes and Challenges

### Operational Inefficiencies:
- **Missed Deadlines:** "Everyone misses deadlines so often, and it has become so bad that we are just comfortable seeing them as guidelines and not something taken that seriously anymore.” A lack of a master calendar, disorganized processes, and last-minute decisions are common.
- **High Air Freight Costs:** In 2011, over 95% of products were flown in from Asian suppliers due to delays, resulting in 2-3% lower margins.
- **Manual Processes:** The warehouse relies on a manual “pick and pack” approach, straining capacity with growth.
- **Lack of Data and Analytics:** The company does not systematically track sales data or understand the profitability of various products, lacking the cost accounting required to analyze contribution margins. “No one has a good sense of the margins of various products within collections.”

### Team Dynamics and Culture:
- **Siloed Structure:** The company operates in four functional silos that don’t communicate effectively. The original founders ("the four old guys") and the design team are closely knit, but the lack of cross-team information sharing leads to dysfunction.
- **Dominating Personalities:** Sarah Bind, a "confident, outspoken, opinionated, and, at times, confrontational" leader, dominates meetings and dismisses alternative views.
- **Lack of Company Culture:** Limited company-wide events and communication of major wins. “Despite its intimate size, the firm communicated major changes in email messages.”
- **Generational Differences:** Differences in age, gender, and perspective between the founding group and the younger design and merchandising teams.
- **Work-Life Balance:** Mulder wants to instill a culture that supports a better work-life balance. “She wanted to instill a culture where everyone shared in the successes of others and supported one another when life was challenging."

### Strategic Decisions
- **E-commerce:** The most significant strategic challenge is whether to launch e-commerce. Mulder sees it as essential for growth and increased margins ("e-commerce could constitute 20% of the $100 million objective") while Spellman is cautious about the economics. Other executives are also wary or lack expertise.
- **Brand Development:** Mulder wants to build brand strength and direct engagement with consumers, noting that the "company lacked systematic data and analytics."
- **Board Relationships:** It's unclear to Mulder if she reports to Spellman or the whole board. The board has limited retail experience and is primarily focused on financial results, with different views on the best growth strategy.

## 5. Key Personnel

- **Dorian Lightbown (Creative Director):** Talented designer with a focus on knitwear; prefers to avoid conflicts. "My focus is best kept on design—I’m happy to have others manage ongoing operations. By temperament, I try to avoid conflicts.”
- **Sarah Bind (Senior Merchandiser):** Experienced industry veteran with a strong, but at times overbearing, management style. She sees herself as the integrator of the whole company. She views the primary focus of operations to be the department store business.
- **Jim Buckley (CFO):** Long-time associate of Spellman. Handles finance, IT, most HR functions and customer service.
- **Kevin Muldoon (Head of Distribution):** Experienced in shipping and logistics but the warehouse operations are stretched.

## 6. Immediate Needs and Action Items for Mulder

- **Develop a Comprehensive Action Plan:** The board is urging her to create a plan for the next 18-24 months to address operational inefficiencies, cultural issues and growth challenges.
- **Address Operational Issues:** Implement improved planning, costing and design-to-production processes to eliminate missed deadlines and reduce air freight costs.
- **Improve Team Dynamics:** Address the siloed organizational structure and improve communication and collaboration across teams.
- **Make the E-commerce Decision:** Convince reluctant board members and executives of the potential for the e-commerce channel, or develop an alternative growth strategy without it.
- **Address Bind's Management Style:** Find a way to integrate Bind's expertise while addressing her dominating and confrontational style.
- **Clarify Reporting Lines:** Establish a clear understanding of her reporting structure with Spellman and the board.
- **Brand Building:** Develop a plan to strengthen the brand.
- **Potential Board Member:** Decide if and when to bring Carolyn Risoli on the board.

## 7. Conclusion

Susie Mulder is stepping into a company poised for growth but hindered by operational and strategic challenges. She must navigate the complexities of the business, improve company culture, build a strong leadership team, and effectively address the e-commerce question to meet the expectations of her investors and achieve NIC+ZOE's full potential. The immediate challenge is developing a well-defined action plan that addresses the firm's deep-seated structural and operational problems.
