# Briefing Document: Commerce Bank Case Study

**Date:** October 26, 2023  
**Subject:** Analysis of Commerce Bank's Unique Strategy and Challenges  
**Sources:** "Commerce Bank" Harvard Business School Case Study (2006)

## Executive Summary:

This case study details the extraordinary growth and success of Commerce Bank, a regional bank that defied industry norms by focusing intensely on customer service and the "retail experience," mimicking successful retailers like Starbucks and Home Depot rather than traditional banks. Commerce differentiated itself through extended hours, a vibrant branch culture, a focus on employee engagement, and a strong emphasis on “WOW!” customer service. The case also explores the bank's innovative "Retailtainment" initiative and raises questions about balancing its unique culture with the need for consistent execution. While experiencing rapid growth and success, Commerce faces challenges of maintaining service quality as it scales and whether or not to continue expanding their customer experience initiatives.

## Key Themes and Concepts:

### Customer-Centric Approach:

- **"WOW!ing" the Customer:** Commerce's core philosophy revolves around exceeding customer expectations, not just meeting them. This is encapsulated in their "WOW!" program. CEO Vernon Hill states, *"We want to exceed customers’ expectations every time they visit our bank."*
- **Branches as "Stores":** Commerce viewed its branches as retail outlets, rather than just banking facilities, drawing comparisons to retailers such as Starbucks and Home Depot.
- **Service over Price:** Commerce deliberately paid lower interest rates on deposits to invest in enhanced customer service. Hill stated, *"...62% said they picked a bank for service, convenience, and those kinds of things. Well, the competition is competing on the 3%; we decided to compete on the 62%."*
- **Convenience and Accessibility:** Extended hours (including evenings and weekends), drive-through service, and other customer-friendly features aimed to make banking more convenient. This is illustrated by the "10-minute rule" where branches opened 10 minutes early and closed 10 minutes late.

### Unique Culture and Employee Engagement:

- **"Wack Job" Hiring:** Commerce actively sought out employees who were passionate about service, even those who might be considered unconventional. John Manning noted, *"We hire wack jobs. You’re all wack jobs. And it is your responsibility to go out there and find more wack jobs."*
- **Intensive Training:** Commerce University played a crucial role in indoctrinating new employees into the "WOW!" culture. The “Traditions” program introduced new hires to how to smile, shake hands, and greet customers.
- **Incentive Programs:** The WOW! program included awards, commendations, and compensation, using tangible rewards (WOW! stickers) and public recognition to motivate employees.
- **Emphasis on Leadership, Not Just Jobs:** Commerce encouraged its employees to be passionate leaders with EVP DiFlorio stating, *"Don’t come here for a job, come to be a leader, be passionate."*

### Rejection of Industry Norms:

- **Branch-Centric Model:** Unlike competitors pushing customers toward online banking, Commerce emphasized its physical branch network and aimed to make each visit a positive experience. Hill stated, *"Other banks decided to push consumers out of the branch because it is the high-cost delivery channel. They wanted to push them online. We totally reject that. You can’t name me one retailer in this country that has pushed people where they don’t want to go and succeeded."*
- **Organic Growth:** Commerce focused on building branches from scratch and was highly critical of growth through mergers and acquisitions. Vernon Hill asserted, *"You can only build a delivery model like this from scratch. Mergers and acquisitions are cost-cutting devices at their heart, and the merger of cultures and the dilution of brand is a formula for failure. Every big bank merger in this country has failed."*
- **Low Expense Ratio is a Minus:** Commerce challenged the typical industry view of a low expense ratio as desirable, claiming that those who do are “every day disinvesting in their business”.

### Strategic Growth and Expansion:

- **Aggressive Market Entry:** Commerce's entry into New York City was aggressive, with high promotional spending, and was very successful.
- **Targeting Competitors' Weaknesses:** Commerce sought out areas where competitors were failing, and offered better service, drawing from merged banks.
- **Focus on Core Deposits:** The bank emphasized growing its deposit base as its primary goal. Hill explained, *"We believe the value of a bank is not its loan base but rather the deposit base, what we call core deposits. Those are deposits that come to you for non-rate reasons."*
- **Branch Location Strategy:** The selection of a corner that was busy, but not too busy, with a good residential and commercial mix was important. CEO Vernon Hill himself made location calls based on gut feeling rather than solely data.
- **Branch Consistency:** Each branch is built using the same mold to ease the customer experience as *“They know what the deal is wherever they visit one of our banks.”*

### The "Retailtainment" Dilemma:

- **Attempting to Innovate:** The “Retailtainment” program explored adding entertainment (hot dogs, musicians, etc.) to branch lobbies to further enhance the customer experience.
- **Risk of Inconsistency:** The case raises concerns about whether Retailtainment could be implemented consistently across all branches and if it could detract from the core service model. Jacovelli questioned, *"She wondered whether customers really wanted to be entertained when they visited a bank branch."*
- **Customer Experience:** Although the branch was often busy, customers would prefer fast service to greeting or entertainment. A customer complained, *"There are too many greeters standing around not doing anything."*
- **Branding Implications:** The decentralized nature of Retailtainment raised questions about maintaining a consistent brand image and customer experience.

### Measurement and Performance:

- **Mystery Shopping:** Commerce heavily used mystery shopping to measure service quality, tying staff raises to the results, with leagues being organized to create a competition.
- **Performance Metrics:** Key performance metrics included deposit growth, customer satisfaction scores, and results from mystery shopping programs, all based on WOW! standards and goals.

## Key Data Points:

- **Deposit Growth:** Commerce experienced deposit growth of over 30% per year since 1996, and almost 40% in 2001 alone.
- **Net Income:** The bank's net income doubled from 1998-2001, compared to 20% for the industry as a whole.
- **Branch Growth:** Commerce grew to 185 branches by 2001.
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Customer satisfaction was significantly higher than that of other retail banks, who scored a 53% “very satisfied” rating compared to 79% for Credit Unions.
- **Cross-Sell:** Typical banks had a cross-sell of 1.5-2.5 products. Commerce doesn't specify their cross-sell but sets goals higher than the industry average.

## Strategic Questions Raised:

1. Can Commerce maintain its unique culture and service quality as it continues to scale rapidly?
2. Is "Retailtainment" a logical extension of Commerce's brand and customer-focused approach, or does it represent a potential distraction?
3. How can Commerce balance branch manager autonomy with the need for brand consistency?
4. What steps should Commerce take to stay ahead of competitors who are starting to adopt similar service-oriented strategies?

## Conclusion:

Commerce Bank's success was built on a radical departure from traditional banking practices, emphasizing customer service, employee engagement, and a retail-oriented mindset. The case illustrates the power of creating a strong culture and focusing on the customer experience. However, it also raises important questions about the challenges of scaling a differentiated business model and maintaining that differentiation while competitors start to mimic the model, especially when it comes to new initiatives like Retailtainment. The question lies whether to stay with tried and tested models, or continue innovating and risk diluting the model.
