# Briefing Document: Rosalind Fox at John Deere

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Subject:** Analysis of Rosalind Fox's Leadership at John Deere's Des Moines Works Factory

## Executive Summary:

This briefing document examines the case study of Rosalind Fox, the factory manager at John Deere's Des Moines Works. It details her career trajectory, the challenges she faced upon assuming her role, the strategies she employed, and the current state of the factory. The case highlights a complex interplay of financial performance, employee engagement, diversity and inclusion, and leadership effectiveness within a large manufacturing context. Despite achieving record profitability, the factory struggles with low employee engagement, primarily stemming from concerns about pay and a perceived disconnect with leadership.

## Key Themes and Ideas:

### Rosalind Fox's Background and Career Trajectory:
- Fox's journey is marked by overcoming barriers as a Black woman in engineering and manufacturing.
- She faced racism and isolation growing up and in her early career, but remained focused on her goal to become a factory manager: "I decided I would love to be a factory manager someday.”
- Fox's career progressed through roles at 3M, Ford, and finally John Deere. She had to learn to assimilate to a predominantly white male culture early in her career: "I wasn’t myself for the first few years because I was trying really hard to assimilate to the predominantly white male culture."
- She initially rejected a position at Deere due to the lack of diversity but was persuaded by a mentor, Tony Worthington, who saw her potential. She said of him: "He kept true to his word. He took me under his wing and made moves for me that I know he caught flak for. He helped me develop."

### Challenges at Des Moines Works:
- **Complexity:** The Des Moines Works is a complex facility with four product lines (sprayers, cotton harvesters, grain drills, and tillage equipment), making it one of Deere's most challenging plants to manage. "We produce four product lines under the same roof with three product line directors. On one day, you may have three different problems affecting your production."
- **Initial Resistance:** Fox, as a mid-career hire and the first Black woman to lead the plant, faced resistance from some union members.
- **Learning Curve:** Fox had to quickly learn the specifics of agricultural manufacturing and the nuances of the Des Moines Works, which differed greatly from her previous plant in North Carolina: "I was too embarrassed to ask questions because I felt like people would say, 'Why did they put you in the charge if you don’t know these things?'"
- **Employee Engagement:** Despite strong financial performance, employee engagement was low, largely due to pay dissatisfaction and the perceived absence of leadership on the factory floor. "The first and largest cause stemmed from dissatisfaction with pay, even though wages were considered competitive. Second, employees complained that the factory’s leaders were absent from the factory floor."
- **Conflicting Priorities:** Managing the competing needs of three product line directors (and therefore three bosses) created challenges for Fox. "When she came here, there were a lot of fights between us. Roz had the great idea of holding quarterly meetings in which we would all present our projects and our needs at the same time in the same room."

### Strategies Employed by Fox:
- **Building a Diverse Leadership Team:** Fox assembled a diverse leadership team, bringing in new perspectives and experiences. “The leadership team was working on a proposal about how Des Moines Works should be thinking about digital tools and technology…She saw something in me that I did not anticipate.”
- **Focus on Metrics and Accountability:** Fox established clear goals and held her team accountable for their performance. She adopted a philosophy of serving her team: "It became apparent to me that I had to be a leader in serving them."
- **Empowering Leadership:** She empowered her direct reports and gave them autonomy, which resulted in a strong and trusting work environment. "She asks probing questions. There’s very little ambiguity in what she wants, but she allows us the freedom to get there the way we see fit."
- **Improved Communication:** Fox initiated regular meetings (daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly) and implemented strategies to create more open dialogue, including "Lunch with Roz" to engage directly with employees, and inviting external speakers to the All Hands meetings. "I’m trying to get more integrated and develop relationships with factory workers."
- **Advocacy:** Fox became an advocate for her team with senior leadership, pushing for their needs and fostering good working relationships. "Roz is not afraid to push the envelope. She’ll say, ‘All they can do is say no, so make me ask.’"
- **Addressing the Pay Issues:** Implemented an internship program for wage workers to allow for advancement opportunities.
- **Transparency:** Open and honest with her staff. "She’s very transparent. I always know where I stand with her."

### Financial Performance:
- The factory achieved record profitability in 2019 through a combination of strong sales of cotton harvesters and cost-reduction measures.
- This financial success came despite a slump in the agricultural equipment industry. "Last year was our record result in volumes and also in financials, despite sales being down in our industry."

### Diversity and Inclusion:
- Fox took on a leadership role in global diversity and inclusion at Deere to help promote equity.
- She leveraged her experience as a Black woman to develop a deeper understanding of the challenges facing minorities and women in the company.
- She initiated programs like "Women in Operations" and John Deere Inspire to support underrepresented groups. "I felt like I couldn’t encourage others to bring their whole selves to work if I wasn’t doing that myself."
- She was intentional about creating an environment where her team could be their whole selves, as she had learned to do.

## Key Issues and Challenges Moving Forward

- **Sustaining Employee Engagement:** Despite initiatives, employee engagement remains a significant concern, requiring innovative solutions, especially given the focus on pay and leadership presence on the factory floor.
- **Balancing Productivity and Engagement:** How to maintain high financial performance while addressing the underlying issues that impact employee satisfaction.
- **Navigating Union Relations:** The need to improve communication and collaboration with the union workforce and its leaders, with potentially conflicting priorities, may prove difficult.
- **Integrating Digital Technologies:** Implementing the "connected factory of the future" initiative.

## Conclusion:

The case of Rosalind Fox at John Deere provides valuable insights into the complexities of leadership, diversity, and organizational change within a large manufacturing environment. Fox's ability to build a strong team, improve financial performance, and navigate political and cultural challenges makes her a compelling case study. However, the continued issues with employee engagement underscore the importance of continuous efforts to address the needs of the workforce. The case leaves open the question of how Fox will bridge the gap between the leadership team and the factory workers to sustain long-term success.
