# Briefing Document: Jan Carlzon's Leadership and Turnaround Strategies

## Overview:

This document analyzes the leadership and business strategies employed by Jan Carlzon in his turnaround efforts at various companies within the Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), primarily focusing on Vingresor, Linjeflyg, and SAS itself. Carlzon’s approach emphasizes customer-centricity, employee empowerment, and clear communication, departing from traditional, product-focused management styles. The document identifies key themes and quotes from the source material to illustrate these points.

## Key Themes & Ideas:

### Customer-Centricity and Market Orientation:

#### Shifting Focus:
Carlzon consistently advocates for a shift from product-oriented thinking to a customer-driven approach. This means understanding what customers actually want, not just what the company assumes they want.

#### Vingresor Example:
Instead of cutting services in a down market, Vingresor squeezed costs and restructured to be more flexible, anticipating a market recovery and ultimately turning a profit.
> "In a sagging market, most product-oriented executives would have cut back on service. But this would only bring in less revenue... Instead, we chose to squeeze costs."

#### Linjeflyg Example:
Recognizing that its business was primarily business travelers, Linjeflyg shifted from a politically driven objective to a customer-focused approach based on "convenient timetables, frequent departures, and low prices."

#### SAS Example:
Carlzon emphasized, 
> "We decided to stop regarding expenses as an evil that we should minimize and to begin looking at them as resources for improving our competitiveness."  
SAS focused on the frequent business traveler, tailoring services to their needs and being prepared to spend money on what served that customer.

#### Real Customer Needs:
Carlzon emphasizes the importance of actually asking customers, referencing the example where Vingresor managers' assumptions about senior travelers was incorrect.
> "After you discover what your customers really want, you can turn to establishing your business goals and a strategy to achieve them."

#### "What Business Are You Really In?":
Carlzon challenges companies to define their business from a customer's point of view.  
> "For example, is SAS in the airline business? Or is it really in the business of transporting people from one place to another in the safest and most efficient way possible? I think it’s obvious that the answer is the latter."

### Employee Empowerment and Decentralization:

#### Shared Responsibility:
Carlzon emphasizes involving employees in the turnaround process by giving them responsibility and encouraging their input.  
> "The only chance for Linjeflyg to survive is if you help me—assume responsibility yourselves, share your ideas and experiences so we have more to work with."

#### Frontline Decision Making:
Carlzon argues for pushing decision-making to the front lines where employees have direct customer contact.  
> "Once we passed responsibility out to the front line, we no longer needed so many market surveys—our decisions were being made by people who had direct contact with the market all the time."

#### Flattening the Pyramid:
He advocates flattening the organizational hierarchy to facilitate faster responses to customer needs and increased employee engagement.  
> "The customer-oriented company is organized for change."  
> "“Managing” is thus shifted from the executive suite to the operational level where everyone is now a manager of his own situation."

#### Support Role of Management:
Managers are redefined as supporting their employees, not administering them. Supervisors need to "ensure that they understood their department’s objectives and had the information and resources required to meet those objectives."

#### Autonomy & Initiative:
Giving employees autonomy allowed for unexpected innovation and created a sense of ownership. An example was the Linjeflyg cabin crew making millions selling items on flights when given control over that project.

### Strategic Focus and Targeted Investment:

#### Strategic Prioritization:
Instead of indiscriminately cutting costs (the "cheese slicer" approach), Carlzon advocates a targeted approach, cutting expenses that don't directly serve the company's strategic goal and investing in things that do.

#### SAS Example:
SAS decided to be "100% better at one thing instead of being 1% better at 100 things" which meant focusing on the business traveler. They were willing to increase operating expenses $12 million a year for 147 projects directly tied to this goal.

#### Saying "No" to Good Ideas:
The importance of resisting good ideas that don't fit within the strategic framework.  
> "The hardest part of making good business deals is to resist making bad business deals."  
An example was refusing to attend the annual tourist industry convention.

#### Airbus Example:
The decision to mothball new, more efficient Airbuses demonstrated the focus on customer needs over product-driven decisions, choosing the less efficient (but more convenient for the customer) DC-9 aircraft.

#### Avoiding Complacency:
The need to continually evolve a strategy instead of becoming "a prisoner of success" is noted, and the “second wave” at SAS was a push to develop the company in preparation for a possible deregulation of the airline industry.

### Clear and Consistent Communication:

#### Simplicity and Clarity:
Carlzon champions clear, simple communication to ensure that all employees understand the company’s strategy and their role in achieving it.  
> "It is better to be too clear or too simple than to risk the possibility that one of your employees will misunderstand your message."

#### Authentic Engagement:
Carlzon spent considerable time in the field talking directly with employees, using plain language and often delivering messages that feel obvious in retrospect.  
> "By listening to the employees and speaking in simple terms, I was able to articulate their own thoughts."

#### Symbolic Actions:
He understood that actions and behaviors have symbolic value and can send messages, good or bad, to employees.  
> "Leaders should be aware of how far nonverbal communication can go in illustrating the style that others in the organization should follow."

### Taking Calculated Risks and "Running Through Walls":

#### Intuition and Boldness:
Carlzon often made bold decisions based on intuition, even if the math looked unfavorable, a method he described as "let my intuition outweigh the mathematical computations."

#### Overcoming Obstacles:
He encourages a proactive, determined approach to overcoming perceived obstacles ("Run through walls").  
> "Your goal may seem impossible, but don’t stop trying to accomplish it until someone really says no. The walls towering before you may not be as massive as they appear."

#### Misunderstandings as Opportunities:
Carlzon notes that "My misunderstanding... inspired me to run through a wall and increase Vingresor’s profits substantially."

#### Facing External Opposition:
Even when faced with strong external opposition, like the conflict with Air France over EuroClass, Carlzon and SAS were willing to challenge the status quo and risk conflict for their strategy.

### Employee Recognition and Rewards:

#### Beyond Financial Incentives:
Carlzon emphasizes the importance of non-financial rewards, such as recognition, responsibility, and trust.  
> "A better reward for doing a good job is being awarded well-defined responsibility and trust. Helping talented people blossom and develop is one of management’s toughest challenges."

#### Symbolic Rewards:
Recognizing the importance of both individual and group accomplishments, SAS awarded symbolic gifts like the gold watch and gold heart.

#### Genuine Praise:
Carlzon notes that praise should be genuine because  
> "Receiving unmerited accolades can be an insult that reveals indifference on the part of the bestower."

## Conclusion:

Jan Carlzon's leadership and turnaround strategies are a powerful example of customer-centric, employee-driven management. His success lay not just in financial analysis and strategic planning, but in his ability to empower his workforce, communicate a clear vision, and take calculated risks to reshape his organizations in the customer's favor.
